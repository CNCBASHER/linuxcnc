The configuration files for generating 4-axis stepper pulses with a Mesa
Anything IO board with USB interface (7i43 usb). It packs position commands
along with corresponding time information into wishbone-over-usb stream.
The realtime task is done by the FPGA of 7i43. As a result, the RTAI is not
required.

Those configurations were taken from configs/scara/, and modified by Yishin
Li, Arais Robot Technology Inc.
