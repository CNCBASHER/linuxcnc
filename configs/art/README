The proto configuration drives 4-axis stepper pulses using a Mesa Anything
IO board with USB interface (7i43 usb). It packs position commands along 
with corresponding time information into wishbone-over-usb stream. The
realtime task is done by the USB device. As a result, the RTOS is not
necessary.

proto.ini
---------
  this config has 4 StepGens 
  The config will only run if you have libwbou installed.


scara.ini
---------
  Config file for a SCARA type robot.
  You need to specify what kinematics should get used (loadrt scarakins in your hal file)
  If you change the HOME location in TRAJ, make sure you change the appropiate HOME locations of the AXES 
  aswell, and make sure the position match (when run through the kinematics).
