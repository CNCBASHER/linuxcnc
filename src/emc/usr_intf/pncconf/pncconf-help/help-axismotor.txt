* Servo Info:
    This is for setting up the servo control loop.
        P - proportional term
        I - integral term
        D - derivative term
        FF0 - zero order feed forward
        FF1 - first order feed forward
        FF2 - second order feed forward
        Bias - 
        Deadband - if the actual position is in this band
            of the commanded proportional control will not be 
            added.
        Dac scale      - scales the output nominal is +-1 volt
        Dac Max output - clamps the output to +- this value
        Dac offset     - used to offset dac range. 
        Encoder Lines  - Will be multiplied by four to get
            quadrature pulses per revolution.
        
* Open loop servo test:
    Use this test to confirm proper Dac output.
    It is important to confirm the motor turns in the positive
    direction when the positive jog button is pressed.
    It is important to confirm the encoder counts in the positive 
    direction when the motor turns in the positive direction.
    If this is not true expect a SERVO MOTOR RUN AWAY when using
    PID control!
    You can also confirm the encoder scaling is correct, by moving
    the axis a known distance and noting the encoder count.
    The limit switches are not functional during this test.

* Stepper Info:
    This is for setting up the Stepper control loop:
        step on time    - minimum time in nanoseconds for the step pulse.
        Step Space      - minimum time between steps.
        Direction Hold  - minimum time between last step and direction change.
        Direction Setup - minimum time for direction signal.
        Driver type     - choose a pre determined driver timing
        motor steps     - number of electrical steps for motor usually 200
        microstepping   - microstepping multiplication factor.
        motor steps times microstepping = number of steps per revolution.

* Axis info:
    Pulley Ratio     - use this if using a pulley or gear drive.
                       or 1:1 for direct drive.
    Leadscrew        - pitch (metric) or TPI of leadscrew.
    Max velocity     - in units per MINUTE.
    Max Acceleration - in units per SECOND squared.  
    Rapid speed following error - amount actual can deviate from commanded.
    Feed speed following error  - amount actual can deviate from commanded.
    Invert motor direction      - check to reverse motor direction
    Invert encoder direction    - check to reverse encoder direction

* Test / Tune Axis:
    Use this to test and tune the current axis.
    set the velocity, acceleration and control loop settings.
    jog to a safe zone close to the middle of axis.
    set the test distance and choose a movement type:
        +- for moving both sides of start point.
        - for moving between zero and negative side.
        + for moving between zero and positive side.
    choose a pause time.
    press run and the test will move back and forth pausing 
    at each end of travel.
    pressing OK will transfer the settings to the axis page.
    pressing cancel will keep the existing settings.
