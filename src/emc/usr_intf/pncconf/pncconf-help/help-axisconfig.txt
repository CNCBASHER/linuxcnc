            ---Axis Configuration---

Also refer to the diagram tab for an example of
home and limit switches. This is one example of
many different ways to set homming and limits.

  Origin:
    The Origin is the machine zero point. EMC2
    uses this point to reference everything else
    from. It should be inside the software limits.
    On a lathe, the X axis Origin must be at the 
    centerline of the spindle for constant surface 
    speed to work correctly.

* Positive Travel Distance:
    This is the distance the Axis travels from 
    the Origin to the positive limit switch. This
    will always be zero or a positive number.

* Negative Travel Distance:
    This is the distance the Axis travels from 
    the Origin to the negative limit switch. This
    will always be zero or a negative number.

* Home position:
    This is the position the home sequence will
    finish at. It is referenced from the Origin
    so can be negative or positive depending on
    what side of the Origin it is located.
    When at the home position position if
    you must move in the Positive direction to
    get to the Origin, then the number will be 
    negative.

* Home switch Location:
    This is the distance from the home switch to 
    the Origin. It could be negative or positive
    depending on what side of the Origin it is
    located. When at the home switch position if
    you must move in the Positive direction to
    get to the Origin, then the number will be 
    negative. If you use home switches combined 
    with limit switches then the home switch 
    location will be the same as either the
    Negative travel distance or the Positve 
    travel distance (with negative-combined or 
    positve-combined switches respecfully)

* Home Search Velocity:
    Course home search velocity in units per minute.
   
* Home Search Direction:
    Sets the home switch search direction
    either towards negative limit switch
    or towards positive limit switch

* Home Latch Velocity:
    Fine Home search velocity in units per minute

* Home Final Velocity:
    Velocity used from latch position to home position
    in units per minute. Set to 0 for max rapid speed 

* Home latch Direction:
    Allows setting of the latch direction to the same
    or opposite of the search direction.

* Use Encoder Index For Home:
    EMC2 wil search for an encoder index pulse while in
    the latch stage of homing.

* Use Compensation File:
    Allows specifing a Comp filename and type.
    Allows sophisticated compensation. See Manual.

* Use Backlash Compensaton:
    Allows setting of simple backlash compensation. Can 
    not be used with Compenation File. See Manual.
