External Controls

Limit And Homing Switches:
    This narrows the available signal choices in the mesa and
        parport pages.

USB Joystick Jogging:
    This allows basic jogging with USB devices.
    eg joysticks and keyboards.
    Currently analog controls are not configurable on
    this page, but could be added to a custom hal file.
    Its important to note that if the usb device is not
    connected when EMC is started, It will fail with an error.
    For a device to be usable there must be a device rule.
    To search for rules made by pncconf, click
    'Search for device rule'. It will list found rules and
    device names in the text output window.
    To add a rule have the USB device ready, click
    'add device rule' and follow the prompts.
    To test a device add its name to 'Device Name' and click
    'Test device'. This loads the device and halmeter.
    using halmeter click on a pin name and press buttons till
    you see the response in halmeter. Take note of the pin name
    of the buttons you wish to use for jogging / speed selection.
    When done close the dialog box. The available pin names
    will be displayed in the text output window. Copy
    the wanted pin names into the appropriate boxes.
    Jog speed selection uses two buttons to select four speeds.
 
    no buttons                = default speed
    jog speed select a button = a speed
    jog speed select b button = b speed
    both buttons              = ab speed

    USB jogging cannot be used with external button jogging
    because they both use the same HALUI pins.
    USB jogging uses HALUI and hal_input. For more info see
    the manual and man pages on these components.

External Button Jogging:
    This allows rapid jogging with simple switches
    Choose a single set of buttons, with axis selected 
    by switches, or separate switches for each axis.
    You can set the jog rate.
    The jog signal names must be designated on the mesa page.
    eg 'Jog X+','Jog X-' for separate buttons or
    'Jog Button Selected +' for selectable axis buttons.
    for selectable axis buttons signal names for the 
    select axis must be designated as well.
    eg 'Joint Select A'

    External button jogging uses HALUI. See the manual for 
    more info.

External MPG Jogging:
    Allows jogging with a Manual Pulse Generator.
    Choose a single MPG - with axis selected by
    switches or separate MPGs - for each axis
    (TOUCHY requires a single shared MPG)
    Choose selectable jog rates or a single jog rate.
    (TOUCHY selects its own jog rates) 
    There are 3 inputs used to select up to eight
    Jog rates. The bold face labels - Default, a, b, and c
    Allow simple switches (eg center-off or rotary) to be
    used. The letters represent which signals need to be
    high for the jog rate.( eg abc) requires signals:
    jog-inc-a, jog-inc-b, and jog-inc-c all to be high for
    that jog rate to be selected.)
    The default jog rate is when no jog-inc signals are high
    This is also the rate if a single jog rate is used.
    The jog inc signals will need to be designated on the mesa
    page.
