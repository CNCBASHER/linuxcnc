GUI Configuration Page

Frontend:
    This specifies the graphical display EMC will use.
    Each one has different option. 
    eg. mini does not support estop
        AXIS is the only frontend that fully supports lathes.

Virtual Control Panels:
    Use to add stand-alone pyvcp panels or if AXIS is chosen,
        the panel will be integrated.
    There are sample panels available.
    Choose one and click the display button to see an example.
    Click 'include HAL connections' to have the chosen example 
    connected to EMC
    With standalone panels the geometry options allow setting the 
        initial position and size on the panel. 
    Set them as you like and click the display button 
    (after picking a sample) to see the changes.
    Picking a blank program will tell pncconf to set up 
        blank pyvcp file for a custom built panel.
