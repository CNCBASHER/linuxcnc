Mesa setup page:

Configuration Tab:
    allows you to choose the firmware,
    number of components / number of gpio, 
    frequency of pwm / pdm and the watchdog timeout.
    The base frequency should be set as per the Mesa daughter
    board you are using. Different boards require PDM vrs PWM
    which is set on the connector tabs. 
    pick the firmware you wish to use and 
    you will see the component numbers change   
    default is to have all the available components active. 
    by choosing less of each component frees up gpio
    press 'accept component changes' to have the connector 
    tabs reflect the changes
    any signalnames you had already pick will be lost unless 
    the component is the same as before the change
    Depending on the board chosen, the connector tabs will disapear
    if not available.
    The help page output tab will show the firmware PIN file,
    which shows the default components, their chanel number
    and their IO number. The IO number is useful for changing
    some options such as stepper output pins to open drain.
    For instance: in firmware SVST8_4 to change stepper channel
    0 to open drain outputs, find out their IO numbers.
    step IO number = 48
    direction number = 49
    In your custom HAL file add the commands:

    setp hm2_5i20.0.gpio.048.is_opendrain true
    setp hm2_5i20.0.gpio.049.is_opendrain true

    note that this says GPIO but the IO number corresponds
    to the stepper ouputs. See the manual for more options.

Connector Tabs:
    The available tabs are selected based on the 
    mesa card type.
    The available component types are based on the 
    firmware / component number selected on the setup page.
    The tabs will display the signal names and the component
    types.
    There are six pintypes depending on the components 
    available in the selected firmware:

     GPIO - general purpose input / output

        You can select the type in the pintype combobox
        This includes GPIOI - input, GPIOO - output, and 
        GPIOD - open drain output
        The available signals will change if you switch between 
        GPIOI and GPIOO/GPIOD.

     ENCODER - a hardware base quadrature counter

        You select the A phase signal and the rest of the 
        phases (B, I, and possibly M) are automatically included.
        If using a single input or single input and index for the spindle
        encoder, the encoder must be put in 'counter-mode'. This must be
        manually added in a custom HAL file. For example (changing the board 
        name and encoder number to your requirements):

        setp    hm2_7i43.0.encoder.00.counter-mode 1 

        HAL file. See the Hostmot2 section on encoders for more info about 
        counter mode.

     MUX ENCODER - a hardware base quadrature counter

        You select the A phase signal and the rest of the 
        phases (B, I, and possibly M) are automatically included
        Mux encoders allows two encoders per set of pins by using
        a select pin to choose a second set of encoders. This
        component is used with firmware that requires a special
        daughter board from Mesa.

     RESOLVER - a resolver encoder counter
        used with MESA 7i49 daughter board with special firmware
        Some servos have resolvers rather then quadrature encoders

     PWMGEN - a hardware base pulse width (or density) 
        modulation generator

        You can select:
        PWM -pulse width modulation using pulse and direction output pins
        PWD -pulse density modulation
        UDM -pulse width modulation using up and dowm output pins
        you select the PULSE signal and the direction and enable 
        signals are automatically setup.
        Please see the Mesa daughter board documentaion for the most up-to-date
        recommendations for frequency and type. Here are the common ones: 
        The 7i33 daughter board requires PDM @ 6 MHz.
        The 7i29,7i30,7i40 require PWM @ 20 KHz
        the 7i48 and 7i49 require UDM @ 24 KHz

     3 PWMGEN - special pwm generators used for driving brushless
        servo motors 3 windings directly.
        This is not fully supported yet so the HAl file will need
        commands added to it to finish the config.

     STEPGEN - a hardware based step and direction generator

        only step and direction stepgens are supported
        You select the STEP signal and the direction and enable
        signals are automatically setup

    You could change these options in a custom HAL file
    If you wish to connect a component to something in a 
    custom HAL file write a unique signal name in the combo 
    entry box. Certain components will add endings to your 
    custom signal name.

    Encoder will add < customname > +:
    -position
    -count
    -velocity
    -index-enable
    -reset

    Steppers add:
    -enable
    -counts
    -position-cmd
    -position-fb
    -velocity-fb
    
    PWM add:
    -enable
    -value

Signal selection:
    By selecting signals you are configuring the input and output
    of the mesa boards and selecting how pncconf displays options
    in the upcoming pages.
    PNCconf can configure servo motors, open loop steppers and
    closed loop steppers.
    PNCconf does a sanity check when you push the next button.
    It checks for some obvious problems such as:
    if you select a PWM signal for an axis PNCconf assumes you
    are using a servo motor (except for the spindle)- then you 
    need to select an encoder signal too.
    If you select an encoder you must select an PWM or a stepper
    signal as well (except for a spindle)
    A dialog will pop up letting you know of these detected errors.
    PNCconf will not catch the error of setting two components 
    the same (If fact for GPIO outputs this is fine anyways)
